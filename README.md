# Movie-Recommendation-System
This project builds a Movie Recommendation System using the MovieLens dataset. It implements both Matrix Factorization (NMF) and Collaborative Filtering (cosine similarity) to recommend movies to users. The system is also evaluated using RMSE, Precision@K, and Recall@K.
